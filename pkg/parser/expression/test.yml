# TODO(pstodulk): Missing tests with
#  - interfaces
#  - use of methods
#  - exported/private symbols
#  - pointers
#  - anonymous types
#  - try maps and channels!
#  - - find simple way how to assemble various DataTypes, including
#      maps, slices, .... - think about '@type' format, e.g.:
#         '@map[string]int'
#      Such string should be parsed by ast in suitable way and then can be
#      used some function which creates from this expected data type
#  --- parse special format @type to q
#  - user dict for symboltable to create ST representing other files
